# Rust Concurrency

This repository contains various mini-projects that demonstrate Rust's concurrency features, 
including the use of `Mutex`, `Arc`, and thread-safe operations. Each project is a self-contained 
example showcasing different concepts and use cases.


Feel free to extend or modify these examples to explore more scenarios! ðŸš€
